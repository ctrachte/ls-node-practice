What are ES6 modules and how do they differ from the module we created in this checkpoint?
- ES6 modules are another way of exporting re-usable blocks of code without wrapping them in a closure or object
- they are different in that: 
 1.)You can easily load ES6 modules asynchronously.
 2.)You get compile time errors if you try to import something that has not been exported.

This was a tricky question, and I had some trouble understanding the differences to be honest. Please provide me with any additional explanations. Thanks!
